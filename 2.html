    <h2>CSS</h2>
    <P><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/" target="_blank" title="CCS">Cascading Style Sheets(CSS)</a> is a style sheet <strong>language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language</strong> such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
    <P><u>CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.</u> This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate <strong>.css file</strong>, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</P>
    <P> Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on <strong>Braille-based tactile devices</strong>. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.</P>
    <P>The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.</P>
    <P><u>The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</u>. Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.</P>
    <P>In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL. CSS is also used in GTK widget toolkit.</P>
